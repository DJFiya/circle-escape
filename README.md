# Circle Escape

A simple physics-based animation/game where balls bounce inside a rotating circle with a moving hole. Balls escape through the hole, and new balls spawn when one escapes.

## Features

- Balls bounce inside a circular boundary.
- The circle rotates, and a hole allows balls to escape.
- When a ball escapes, two new balls spawn.
- Colorful balls and a visually appealing animation.
- Gravity slider to manipulate the physics of the system.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- matplotlib

Install dependencies with:
```
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

## How to Run

1. Save `main.py` to your computer.
2. Run the script:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
3. The animation window will appear. Watch balls bounce and escape!

## Customization

- Adjust parameters at the top of `main.py` to change gravity, rotation speed, ball size, etc.
